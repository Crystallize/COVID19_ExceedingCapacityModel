# COVID19_ExceedingCapacityModel
On the 7th August 2020 the Department of Health and Social Care, the Office for National Statistics, the Government Actuaries Department and the Home Office published a report on the direct and indirect impacts of COVID-19 on excess deaths.(3) One section of this document ‘Annex B’ deals with the excess deaths occurring directly as a result of a lack of CCU capacity. In November 2020 a voluntary working party from the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries (IFOA) was invited to help update the report, and this model was developed to address the Annex B in the report.

The model is a series of static compartmental models that estimates the number of deaths under three conditions: availability of both general ward and ITU care; availability of general ward care but no ITU care; and no availability of either general ward or ITU care. 
The model was developed as an Excel workbook. This was chosen as it allows rapid iteration and development with transparency for other developers and reviewers as it is a widely available platform. This paper should be read with reference to the Excel workbook available via the GitHub link above.
